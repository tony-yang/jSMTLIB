The main routine of this Java executable is org.smtlib.SMT,
    but the jar file is an executable jar file, and can be run
    using the command: java -jar jSMTLIB.jar 
THIS IS AN ALPHA VERSION AND STILL BEING CORRECTED AND POLISHED
The command-line arguments are typical options and files.
If no files are present, commands are read from standard input
    until a control-D is read, indicating end of input.
If files are listed on the command-line they are processed
    after all options are read and in the order the fies are listed.
Option names have a long version, beginning with --
    and an abbreviated version, beginning with a single -.
The recognized options are these:
    -h, --help : prints this help message and exits
        --version : prints the version of this application and exits
    -v, --verbose <int>: enables verbose mode, so more stuff is printed
    -s, --solver <name> : indicates the SMT solver to use (or 'test')
        The name of the adaptor class is "org.smtlib.solvers.Solver_" + <name>
    -e, --exec <path> : indicates the SMT solver executable to use
        The argument is the pathname of the executable for the named solver
    -L, --logics <path>: the directory containing SMT-LIB logic and theory 
              definitions (default is to use the internal, built-in definitions)
        --out <file or 'stdout' or 'stderr'>: where to send normal and error output
        --diag <file or 'stdout' or 'stderr'>: where to send verbose (diagnostic) output
        --port <number>: which port to use for client-server communication
        --text: text to process (ignoring file and port input)
        --echo: if enabled, commands are echoed to diagnostic output when successfully parsed
        --abort: if enabled, an error causes immediate exit
        --noshow: if enabled, error location information is not shown
    -q, --nosuccess: if enabled, 'success' responses are suppressed
        --relax: if enabled, extensions to strict SMT-LIB are permitted
